Create a landing page, with an attention-grabbing full screen interactive area built with PixiJS. Something you would expect to see when you first open a site on awwwards.

The page should have three main components:
- A full screen effect/interaction
- A tagline
- A Call to Action

Your interactive effect can include particles, spritesheet animations, filters and effects, etc. 

Explore what is out there, find some references, and make a plan for the pieces you want to explore further.
